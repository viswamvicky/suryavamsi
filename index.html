<h3 align="left"><font color="gray" align="right"><i><font color="red">Life is full of ups and downs</font>, for young people as well as adults. Their ups and downs may seem insignificant to us as adults, but they are there, and our acknowledgement, acceptance and understanding of their feelings and experiences will have a profound impact on their interpretation of relationships, <font color="red">emotions, love, respect and most importantly</font>, it will shape the way they view themselves and their mental wellbeing – now, and in the future. 
Here are a few ideas for using the power of self-care to help children and young people become more introspective and aware of their physical and emotional needs and to promote wellness of <font color="red">the body and mind</font>.
<br><br>Creativity is not limited by arts and crafts and that is the joy of it... It is not limited by anything! Creative activities can provide an outlet for a young person to release or explore their emotions. <font color="red">Drawing, painting, and modelling are more obvious examples of how to use creativity to relax, but other activities such as cooking, creating music, planning a trip, writing a poem or story, or problem-solving activities such as puzzles or lego</font>, also involve creative thinking while providing a chance for personal expression and the development of new skills – crucial for feelings of self-worth.</font></i></h3>
